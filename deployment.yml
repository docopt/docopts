      all examples written for docopts:
        - shebang conversion `#!/bin/bash` ==> `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
        - legacy example completed
        - example from README extracted a file, and merged in README via build_doc.sh
        - sshdiff full example coded
        - added examples with `--auto -G`

      docopts.sh helper:
        - is more documented in the code
        - as a documenation in [docs/README.md](https://github.com/docopt/docopts/tree/v0.6.3-rc1/docs/README.md)
        - now supports bash strict mode (`set -euo pipefail`)
        - now supports `--auto -G` to auto parse with global vars (doesn't use bash 4 associative array)

      `docopts` behavior sould be unchanged:
